  - title: Predictive AI Model for Optimizing ETF Portfolio
    desc: |
      Deep Learning in Finance		
      - Enhanced traditional PCA-based Absorption Ratio (AR) calculation by integrating an ARIMA + LSTM model to predict future asset correlations and variances, enhancing the precision of systemic risk assessments in the U.S. stock market
      - Back-tested the strategy using historical data to validate its real-world potential, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 1.2986 for AR strategy compared to 1.2297 for an equally weighted portfolio, demonstrating the effectiveness of the predictive model in enhancing risk-adjusted returns
