I hold an MSc in Robotics from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), where I completed my thesis at ETH Zurich under Prof. Marco Hutter and Prof. Caglar Gulcehre from EPFL. My interests include robotics perception, reasoning, and actuation, with a focus on 3D vision, robot control/learning, and multimodal learning.

I had the pleasure to work in the labs of Prof. Huijing Zhao at Peking University on 3D perception, Prof. Min Xu at Carnegie Mellon University on Cryo-ET generative models, Prof. Mathieu Salzmann at EPFL on neural networks quantization for object detection and pose estimation.

I was a research intern at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) AI Lab working on multimodal representation learning, and student researcher at Google DeepMind working on extending Vision Language Model with ink modality.

I enjoy board games ðŸŽ², soccer âš½, tennis ðŸŽ¾, and music ðŸŽ¶. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to join in on a hike or play some board games.
